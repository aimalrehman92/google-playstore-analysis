# google-playstore-analysis
A project on a comprehensive analysis of the Google Playstore Apps dataset.

Using the visualization methods, we try to answer the following questions:

-What types and categories of apps are the most popular across the playstore
-What types and categories of apps get the highest number of installations


Using the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, we predict the ratings of the apps based on their attributes with 89% accuracy by training the model over 80% of the dataset and testing on the remaining 20%.
